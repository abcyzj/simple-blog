# Simple Blog
A simple personal website.

## Simple Blogï¼Ÿ
This is my personal website. It is called **Simple Blog** because it is really simple, only contains several different pages. It is now deployed [here](https://yezijie.me).

## Why bother?
I know that you can use Jekyll to generate your blogs and deploy them on **GitHub Pages** and it's more convenient. I wrote this because I just bought a VPS the other day and found this domain(**yezijie.me**) hadn't been registered, I thought it would be fun to write a website and deploy it on my VPS.

## Built With
[Vue](https://vuejs.org) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework


[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
